## Hi there 👋

I am a Danish software developer based in Odense.
I have a degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in Chemistry.

My main strengths are logical backend development and web development with .NET technologies, such as ASP.NET MVC or Blazor. 
On this profile I will mainly be sharing small snippets of things I have worked on, or just ideas that I found interesting enough to be shared.

Currently working on a dynamic searcher for a Blazor application.
